I am a passionate developer doing <u>Python</u> and <u>Django</u> for living.

This does not mean I don't do anything else. In my day to day, I am constantly
managing <u>Linux servers</u>, <u>Nginx</u>, <u>PostgreSQL</u>, <u>Redis</u>
and so on.

I love to learn new languages and contribute to open source projects, so if you
go to my [GitHub](http://github.com/caioariede) page, you will probably see a
mix of languages and projects. The languages I'm most interested in are:
<u>Python</u>, <u>Erlang</u>, <u>Haskell</u>, <u>Rust</u> and <u>Go</u>.

I am from Brazil, but I've been doing <u>remote work</u> for some years.

    :wq -- and yes, I use Vim.
